Newport's Infinity Meter
========================

The content of this repository has been prepared to control a [Newport's 
instrument](http://www.newportus.com/ppt/INFS.html) to measure strain gage. 
It would be extended to other instruments from the same series that have the 
same way to control.

This code can be found in two (mirrored) locations, in [github](https://github.com/srgblnch/NewportInfinityMeter))
 as a repository and in [sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/p/tango-ds/code/HEAD/tree/DeviceClasses/MeasureInstruments/NewportInfinityMeter/))
 as a subdirectiory of tango-ds project.
